# tic tac toe demo

This was a programming test that I was given as part of a job interview.

Can this guy really write python?  I guess you can be the judge of that.

The goal was to write a client-server implementation of Tic Tac Toe, with the front end as HTML/CSS/Javascript,
and the back end in Python.

Here's the result.

* tictacservice is the back end, it is a Python CGI
* tictac.html is the front end, HTML, CSS, Javascript.
